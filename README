RestFB
------------------------------------------------

This project has a dependency on RestFB (http://code.google.com/p/restfb/). 
Unfortunately this project is not yet mavenized, so you need to follow the
instructions stated below : 

First download the restfb api and run the following maven command from the extracted dir. 

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=etc/lib/java/restfb-1.6.jar -DgroupId=com.restfb -DartifactId=restfb -Dversion=1.6 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true

This installs the jar in your local mvn repo, and then add the following dependency to your pom

<dependency>
  <groupid>com.restfb</groupid>
  <artifactid>restfb</artifactid>
  <version>1.6</version>
</dependency>

NOTE : For the purpose of this example, the same has been included in the etc/lib/java/ folder (restfb-1.6.jar)
